# Studio Ghibli Movies
Using the [Studio Ghibli API](https://github.com/janaipakos/ghibliapi) I am displaying in cards all the Studio Ghibli movies with their respective title, description, release date and rotten tomato score. I used pure Vanilla Javascript to fetch the API data. 

Since the API does not provide the movie poster image I had to create an array of links for the movie poster.

Here is the [Demo](https://studioghiblimovies.netlify.app/)

Enjoy!
